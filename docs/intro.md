# Configuration

Letâ€™s configure your iMS Systems.

Information about specific modules and how to use them can be found in their relevant pages on the sidebar within this Knowledge Base. 

It is reccomended to read through this page first before moving on, as you will be unable to utilise the system properly without following these steps first.

**Please Note: This page is mainly for Super Admins. If you are not a Super Admin, you will not have the ability to follow all of these steps below, however some of these are possible if you are a Head of Service.**

## Getting Started

First, you must already have an organisation with iMS Systems as well as your login credentials. If you do not have these yet, please book a [Demo](https://imssystems.tech/bookDemo.php) with us.

If you have these details, then simply access the iMS portal by visiting [portals.imssystems.tech](https://portals.imssystems.tech).

## Logging in

To log into the system, first click within the dropdown labeled `Enter your organisation` and start typing the name of your organisation. Once it appears in the dropdown, make sure to click on it.

Next, simply enter your `Email` and `Password` and click `Login`.

After you have logged into the system, you will be greeted by the Dashboard. 

On the left side of the system you will see the sidebar. You can either click on, or hover over, each of the buttons in order to see which module they link you to. You will see that the module you are currently in is noted by a blue highlight around the button. 

## Create a User

Click on the second button down on the sidebar which is called `Our iMS`. You will then see a drawer open from the sidebar containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Users` and then on the `Create user` tab.

This is where you can add Users to the system. You must first select the `User type`.

The User type selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the following options:

+ Internal

    > This user will have full time access to the system.

+ External

    > This user can either have their access automatically expire within 1 to 5 days, or have the same full time access as an Internal User.

Once you have added one or more members you will need to grant them access to Business Units relevant to their role.

## Create a Business Unit

Using the `Sidebar`, under `Our IMS` click on `Business Units`, then navigate to the `Create a function` tab to create your first Business Unit. 

Here you will find two drop-down menus - the first being `Access type` and the second `Access policy`. 

**Access Type** defines the type of Business Unit you are creating, of which there are `Internal` and `External` types. 

**Access Policy** allows you to pick what features the Business Unit is granted access to;

For now, you can either choose between one of the two pre-made policies or create your own

- iMS Business Unit

- iMS Compliance Body

Once you have successfully created your first Business Unit, proceed to the next step.

## Add a User to a Business Unit

Click on the `Business unit` tab.

Now click on the eye icon to the right of the Business Unit you created earlier.

Navigate to the `Add members` tab and use the two drop down menus to first select the user you created and the role you want to assign them within the Business Unit.

## Access granted

**NOTE:** The user you created will not be able to login until they Verify their account. Upon user creation, an email is sent with a link that expires after 1 hour. The process only requires the user to setup a password.

You are recommended to browse the [General Information][] portion of the User Manual if this is your first time using the iMS System.
