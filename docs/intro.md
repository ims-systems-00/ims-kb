# Configuration

Let’s configure iMS. This should take less than **10 minutes**

More information about the UI, navigating it, and the many buttons can be found in the `General Information` portion of the User Manual. However, it is recommended to complete the Configuration at least once before moving on.

## Getting Started

To get started, we will begin by **creating your organisation** with the appropriate number of licenses (these will be included in the onboarding process).

First, you need to access your organisation’s iMS by visiting the sub-domain within [yourdomain.imssystems.tech][iMS]. As an example, the demo version of iMS is hosted on [my.imssystems.tech][myIMS].

## Create a User

Log in to the system using your **Super Admin** login details and navigate to `Our iMS` from the `Sidebar`, which is on the left side of the screen.

Under `Our IMS` click on `Users`. 

From here, click on the `Create user` tab.

Here you can add users by filling the form. 

Once you have added one or more members you will need to grant them access to Business Units relevant to their role.

## Create a Business Unit

Using the `Sidebar`, under `Our IMS` click on `Business Units`, then navigate to the `Create a function` tab to create your first Business Unit. 

Here you will find two drop-down menus - the first being `Access type` and the second `Access policy`. 

**Access Type** defines the type of Business Unit you are creating, of which there are `Internal` and `External` types. 

**Access Policy** allows you to pick what features the Business Unit is granted access to;

For now, you can either choose between one of the two pre-made policies or create your own

- iMS Business Unit

- iMS Compliance Body

Once you have successfully created your first Business Unit, proceed to the next step.

## Add a User to a Business Unit

Click on the `Business unit` tab.

Now click on the eye icon to the right of the Business Unit you created earlier.

Navigate to the `Add members` tab and use the two drop down menus to first select the user you created and the role you want to assign them within the Business Unit.

## Access granted

**NOTE:** The user you created will not be able to login until they Verify their account. Upon user creation, an email is sent with a link that expires after 1 hour. The process only requires the user to setup a password.

You are recommended to browse the [General Information][] portion of the User Manual if this is your first time using the iMS System.
