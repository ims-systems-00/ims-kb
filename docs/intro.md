# Configuration

Letâ€™s configure your iMS Systems.

Information about specific modules and how to use them can be found in their relevant pages on the sidebar within this Knowledge Base. 

It is reccomended to read through this page first before moving on, as you will be unable to utilise the system properly without following these steps first.

**Please Note: This page is mainly for Super Admins. If you are not a Super Admin, you will not have the ability to follow all of these steps below, however some of these are possible if you are a Head of Service.**

## Getting Started

First, you must already have an organisation with iMS Systems as well as your login credentials. If you do not have these yet, please either book a [Demo](https://www.imssystems.tech/book-demo) with us or [Create your own account](https://app.imssystems.tech/auth/register) which will automatically take you through to setting up your own Organisation as well.

If you have these details, then simply access the iMS portal by visiting [app.imssystems.tech](https://app.imssystems.tech/).

## Logging in

To log into the system, first enter your `Email` and `Password` and click `Login`.

Next, you will be greeted by a list of all the organisations that you are a part of. Simply click on the name of whichever organisation you wish to access.

After you have logged into the system, you will be greeted by the Dashboard. 

On the left side of the system you will see the sidebar. You are able to expand and collapse the sidebar at any time via the blue arrow button near the top-left hand side. You can click on the name of certain modules, those with a *>* icon next to the name, to showcase all the different pages you can access within that module. The module, and page, you are currently in is noted in blue on the sidebar.

## Create a User

To begin creating a new user, navigate to and click on the `Our iMS` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see further options appear underneath this button containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Users` and then on the `Add user` button in the top right-hand side.

This will open a drawer where you can add Users to the system. You must first enter their `Email` address.

Next, you must select their `User type`.

The `User type` selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the following options:

+ Super Admin

    > This user will have full access to all modules, as well as be able to view all data from any created business unit(s). They are able to add new users, business units and business premises, alongside being able to request more licences at any time via the `My Organisation` option, accessible via the dropdown menu from their profile picture in the top-right side of the screen.

+ Head of Service

    > This user will have full access to all of the basic modules within their business unit as well as limited version of `Our iMS` that is specific to their business unit. They are able to add new users and business premises to their own business unit here, as well as send a licence request to their **Super Admin**.

+ Basic User

    > This user will have full access to all of the basic modules within their business unit but a limited, read-only, access to `Our iMS`.

+ Internal Auditor

    > This user will have read-only access to all of the basic modules within the entire system, with full access to the `Audits` module.

+ External Auditor

    > This user will have read-only access to all of the basic modules within the entire system, with full access to the `Audits` module.

+ External User

    > This user will have partial full access to the basic modules as well as read-only access to others, such as `Our iMS` and `Compliance`.

Finally, click `Confirm` to create the user. This will utilise 1 of your user licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the top of the drawer. After creating this user, the system will send out an email to allow them to create and verify their own account.

*Users must both **create their own account** and be **verified** in order to access the system. If they create their account after following the link within the email they recieve after the process above, they will be automatically assigned to your Organisation after verification.*

## Create a Business Unit

To begin creating a new Business Unit, navigate to and click on the `Our iMS` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see further options appear underneath this button containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Business Units` and then on the `Create a function` tab.

This is where you can add Business Units to the system. You must first select the `Access type`.

The `Access type` selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the following options:

+ Internal business function

    > This access type is effectively for teams or departments within the same company, such as HR, Operations and Finance.

+ Internal compliance function

    > This access type is effectively for internal teams or departments within the company responsible for auditing your Organisation.

+ External compliance function

    > This access type is for outside parties that would need access to your iMS Systems in order to audit your Organisation.

+ External function

    > This access type is for any other outside parties that you wish to grant access to your iMS Systems.

*The form will be completely different based on this choice.*

### Creating a Business Unit with either *Internal Business Function* or *External Function* Access Type

After selecting either `Internal business function` or `External function` for the `Access type` dropdown, you will then need to enter the `Name` of the Business Unit, followed by its `Operating location` and `Responsibility`.

Finally, click `Create` to create the business unit. This will utilise 1 of your business unit licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this business unit, you will then be able to add members to it.

### Creating a Business Unit with *Internal Compliance Function* or *External Compliance Function* Access Type

After selecting either `Internal compliance body` or `External compliance function` for the `Access type` dropdown, you will then need to enter the name of the `Compliance body`, followed by what `Standards` they cover and their relevant `Responsibility`.

Finally, click `Create` to create the business unit. This will utilise 1 of your business unit licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this business unit, you will then be able to add members to it.

## Add a User to a Business Unit

To begin adding a user to a business unit, navigate to and click on the `Our iMS` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see further options appear underneath this button containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Business Units` and then you will see a table which contains all of the business units you have created.

Navigate to the relevant business unit you wish to add a user to and click on their entry within the table to open a pop-up. On this pop-up, click on the `Add members` tab at the top.

Simply select which `User` it is you wish to add to this business unit followed by clicking `Confirm`.

## Access granted

Once you have assigned a user to a business unit, they will then recieve an email notifying them. Provided they have first verified their account, as mentioned above, they will now be able to login and start using iMS Systems.

*The verification email sent to the user has a 1 week deadline before the link no longer works, due to security reasons. You can resend the verification email at any time from the `Users` tab within `Our iMS`.*

<!-- You are recommended to browse the [General Information][] portion of the User Manual if this is your first time using the iMS System. -->
