## Repository Overview

## Repositories

To view any created Repositories, navigate to and click on the `Documents` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see further options appear underneath this button containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Repositories`.

Here you will see a list of all the Repositories that you have access to.

### Create a Repository

To begin creating a new Repository, navigate to and click on the `Documents` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see further options appear underneath this button containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Repositories` and then on the `Create` button on the right-hand side.

This will open a drawer where you can create new Repositories to store your documents within the system. You must first enter a `Name` for the Repository, followed by a `Description`. 

Next, you must select the `Privacy` of the Repository. 

The `Privacy` selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the following options:

+ Organisational

	> This Repository will be visible to the entire organisation.

+ Business Unit

	> This Repository will only be visible to the Business Unit you select.

+ Only me

	> This is a private Repository which can only be viewed by yourself and whomever you choose to share it with.

+ Custom

	> This is a private which can only be viewed by yourself and the selected audience members.

If you select the *Business Unit* privacy, you will have an additional drop-down where you can select the `Business Unit` you wish to create this Repository in.

If you select the *Custom* privacy, you will have an additional drop-down where you can select the `Audience` that you wish to grant access to this Repository to.

*This audience can consist of multiple Users across multiple different Business Units.*

For all privacy types, other than *Only me*, you will then have to select the `Owner(s)` of the Repository.

*There can be a maximum of 3 Repository Owners, including yourself, for each Repository. These Repository Owners will be automatically added as Document Owners to every document that gets uploaded within the Repository.*

The remaining steps apply to **all** privacy types.

Finally, regardless of your privacy selection, you must select the `Review interval` for the Repository.

+ Quarterly
+ Half yearly
+ Yearly

Finally, click `Create repository` to create the Repository which will be visible in the `Repositories` table.

*Upon creating a new Repository, you will be taken inside of it straight away.*

In order to `Amend` a Repository, you must first ensure that you are one of the *Repository Owners* within the relevant Repository first, then simply ensure you are within the Repository.

Once you are within the relevant Repository, you can click on the three-dots menu button on the right-hand side of the repository, next to the *files total*. From here you simply click on the button to `Edit Repository`.

You will be able to amend the following fields:
