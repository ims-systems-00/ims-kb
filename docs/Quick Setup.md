Welcome to iMS Systems knowledge base. This page contains multiple videos and instructions on how to quickly get started with setting up your iMS Systems. If you are the **Super Admin** and wish to view configuration instructions in more detail, please view the **Our iMS** page.

2. Click on the `Create a function` button at the top.
3. Select `Internal business function` or `External function` for the `Access type`.
4. Fill in the fields that appear with the relevant information.
5. Click on `Create`.

## Step 2 - Adding a Certification Body

1. Go to `Our iMS` on the sidebar and click on `Business Units`.
2. Click on the `Create a function` button at the top.
3. Select `Internal compliance function` or `External compliance function` for the `Access type`.
4. Fill in the fields that appear with the relevant information.
