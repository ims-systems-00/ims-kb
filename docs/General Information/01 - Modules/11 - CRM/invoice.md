# Invoicing

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `CRM` button on the Sidebar, then on `Customers & Prospects`

From here, find the customer you want to add the invoice to and click on the eye icon. **NOTE:** *You can only add an invoice to a live customer.*

Once you have opened the customer details, navigate to the `Invoice` tab. From here, you will be able to manage a customer's invoices.

### Create an Invoice

Navigate to the `Create invoice` tab.

Here, you can select a `Payment due date` and click `Add Item` and fill the form.

You can apply any discounts to the total at the end and click on `Preview` to see what the invoice will look like.

#### Save

Click on the `Save` button if you do not want to immediately send the invoice to the customer. This will allow you to make changes and amend the invoice before deciding to send it.

If you choose to save an invoice, you can later make changes or send it to the customer by navigating to the `Invoices` tab and clicking on the eye icon next to the relevant invoice.

Clicking `Save` will create a **Draft**.

#### Save and Send

Alternatively, you can click on `Save and send` and this will immediately send the invoice to the customer. You will not be able to make changes to the invoices after sending it.

Clicking `Save and send` will mark the draft as **Sent**.

#### Mark as Paid

To mark and invoice as paid, it must have been sent to a customer. Then, open the invoice details by clicking the eye icon, and click on `Mark as paid`.

Clicking `Mark as paid` will mark the invoice as **Paid**. A paid invoice cannot be deleted.

You can also `Download` or `Resend` an invoice.
