#### Categories

After clicking the `Audits` button, you must now select which category of Audits you want to create or view the schedule/history of.

The following categories are available.
+ Internal - These are Audits performed in-house
+ External - These are Audits performed by Compliance Bodies

*Note that Internal/External Audits still require you to create a Business Unit through which the Audits will be done*

#### Creating an Audit

You must first choose the `Business Unit` that will be Audited followed by the `Compliance Body` that will be performing the Audit. Next, you must give a `Title` for the Internal Audit. Then pick the `Auditor`, this will be a drop-down menu that you can select Users from the Compliance Body. 

*The Business Unit and Compliance Body selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the Business Units and Compliance Bodies your organisation has created.*

Next, you assign a `Date` and `Time` the Audit will take place. 

After selecting the `Interval` of the audit, click `confirm` to submit the Audit to the **Schedule**.
