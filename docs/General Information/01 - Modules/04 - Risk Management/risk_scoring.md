# Risk Scoring

## The Scoring System

#### Likelihood Score

| Likelihood Score 	| 1 	| 2 		| 3 		| 4 	 | 5 			  |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|:---------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------------:|
| **Description** 	| Rare	| Unlikely	| Possible	| Likely | Almost Certain |
|**Frequency** - <br/>How often it might/does happen | This will probably never happen | Do not expect it to happen/recur but it is possible | Might happen/recur occasionally | Will probably happen/recur but is not a persisting issue | Will undoubtedly happen/recur, possibly frequently |
|**Example** 		| Has never happened or over 15 years since the last occurrence | Between 10 and 15 years since the last occurrence | Between 2 and 10 years since the last occurrence | Between 6 months and 2 years since the last occurrence | Regularly or less than 6 months since the last occurrence |

#### Consequence Score

| Consequence Score | 1 		 | 2 	 | 3 		| 4 	| 5 		   |
|:-----------------:|:----------:|:-----:|:--------:|:-----:|:------------:|
| **Description** 	| Negligible | Minor | Moderate	| Major | Catastrophic |
| **Example**: <br/>Quality of Service | Small element of the service is sub-optimal | Overall service is sub-optimal | Overall service has significantly reduced effectiveness | Non-compliance with regulatory standards with significant risk to service effectiveness | Incident leading to totally unacceptable level of service or major disruptions |
| **Example**: <br/>Business Objectives / Projects | Insignificant cost increase | <5 percent over project budget | 5-10 percent over project budget | 10-25 percent over project budget <br/><br/>Key objectives not met | >25 percent over project budget <br/><br/>Key objectives not met |

| Likelihood		|  				| 			|  Consequence	|			|					|
|:------------------|:-------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|
| 					|**Negligible**	| **Minor**	| **Moderate**	| **Major**	| **Catastrophic**	|
|**Almost Certain**	| 5 			| 10 		| 15 			| 20 		| 25 				|
|**Likely**    		| 4 			| 8  		| 12 			| 16 		| 20 				|
|**Possible**  		| 3 			| 6  		| 9  			| 12 		| 15 				|
|**Unlikely**		| 2 			| 4  		| 6  			| 8  		| 10 				|
|**Rare**    		| 1 			| 2  		| 3  			| 4  		| 5  				|

### Criteria

| Risk Rating	| Net Risk Assessment	| Risk Response	|
|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------:|
| High		| 16 - 25	| Unacceptable level of risk exposure which requires action to be taken urgently. |
| Medium	| 10 - 15	| Acceptable level of risk, but one which requires action and active monitoring to ensure risk exposure is reduced. |
| Low 		| 1 - 9		| Acceptable level of risk based on the operation of normal controls. In some cases, it may be acceptable for no mitigating action to be taken. |
