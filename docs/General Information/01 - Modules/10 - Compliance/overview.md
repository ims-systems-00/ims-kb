# Overview

The Compliance Overview shows you various statistics for each individual compliance toolkit.

The first graph shows the completion of each section of the toolkit, followed by a chart that compares the number of *selected* controls versus the number of controls actually *implemented*, and finally a chart that shows the overall compliance adoption percentage.

+ A selected control is a clause that is applicable to your organisation; you should select all controls that are applicable to your organisation.

+ An implemented control is a clause that has been adopted by your organisation; you should implement all controls that your organisation has adopted and put in practice.
