## Making Changes to a Control

<iframe width="426" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Itpgol3b3U" title="Compliance Controls" alt="10-01 - Compliance - Controls (Video)" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After navigating to the compliance toolkit, you will see the [Overview][]. From here, click on the tab at the top which will have the name of the toolkit.

Here, you need to find the clause(s) you need to make changes to.

Once you have found the clause, click on the eye icon under the actions field, then navigate to the `Control` tab.

*Note: Some clauses will have extra details in the `Details` tab, under the `Description` field.*

There are only two fields you can change here,

+ Select Control
+ Status

The first, `Select Control`, allows you to change whether your Organisation aims to adopt this control or not.

The second, `Status`, allows you to adjust whether your Organisation has adopted the control or not.

You cannot adopt a control that is not selected - this means you cannot choose `Implemented` unless the control is already `Selected`.

You can also upload attachments and add comments here.
