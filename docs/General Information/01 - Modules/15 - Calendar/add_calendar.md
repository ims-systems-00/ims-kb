## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Calendar` button at the bottom of the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to the Calendar click [here][Calendar].

### Adding an Event

To add an Event to the `Calendar`, you first need to pick a date to add an event/agenda to. Once you have found the date you wish to add an event to, click on the day and a form should pop up.

You first need to give the event a name in `Event title`, the time the event will `Start` and `End`, as well as a `Description` that fits the event.

**Please note that Auditors do not have access to the Calendar.**

Once you are done entering the details, simply click `Create` and the event will be added to the Calendar.

You can also [modify][Modifying Calendar] and [delete][Deleting Calendar] events on the calendar.
