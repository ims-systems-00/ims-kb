After creating a Premise it will be shown on the `Premises` tab. 

You can add a single Premise to multiple Business Units and they will be displayed as a list.

You can edit Premises by clicking the eye icon and navigating to the `Amend premise` tab, and you can delete Premises using the trash can icon. The ability to delete Premises may be limited to Super Users if they were assigned to multiple Business Units during creation.
