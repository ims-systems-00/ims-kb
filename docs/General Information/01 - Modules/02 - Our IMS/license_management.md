# License Management

## Organisation Overview

| Licenses Allocated |
| :----------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses allocated to your organisation by iMS. |

| Licenses Used |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses used for the various Business Units or Users within your organisation. |

| Licences Remaining |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses that are not used anywhere. |

## Internal / External

Here, you can view how Users are allocated to Business Units within your organisation.

**HOS**, **Basic** and **Auditor** are the three different User Types that can be created.

**User Licences are consumed upon creating a User**. These licences can be returned by deleting the user.

**Business Unit Licences are consume upon created a Business Unit**. These licences cannot be returned, as Business Units cannot be deleted.

To allocate or revoke **Toolkit access** within a Business Unit, simply click on the eye icon to the right of the Business Unit and navigate to the `Tools` tab. From here, you can use the form to either `Allocate` or `Revoke` **Toolkit access** within that specific Business Unit.

## Request / Requested

This is where you can request licences - if a HoS creates a request it would go to the Superadmin, a Superadmin creating the request would forward it to the iMS team.

The requested tab allows you to view requests you have made, and as a Superadmin, allows you to see requests made by the HoS users within your organisation. You can accept these requests to directly forward the request of licences to iMS.

You can also request access to specific Toolkits for your Business Unit or Organisation depending on user level, this functions the same as requesting User Licences.
