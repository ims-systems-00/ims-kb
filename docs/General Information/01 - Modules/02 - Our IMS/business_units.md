# Business Units

## Creating a Business Unit

Please view the first time configuration guide [here][First Time Configuration] for information on creating Business Functions.

## Access Type

There are two types of Business Units.
+ Internal Function
+ External Function

Internal Functions are effectively departments within the same company - for example when making the HR Department you would pick `Internal Function` as the Access Type as it would be the policy put in place for internal users. 

External Functions on the other hand are for outside parties that need access to the iMS System, such as Compliance Bodies that would audit your Organisation.

## Access Policy

`Access Policies` allow you to limit the features users within the Business Unit have access to.

You can view more information about Access Policies [here][Access Policies].
