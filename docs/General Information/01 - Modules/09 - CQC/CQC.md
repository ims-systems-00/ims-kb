# CQC

## Sites
CQC Sites provide an overview of your organisation's CQC compliance at a single glance. You can manage multiple sites from one system, although the visibility of the sites themselves, as well as the ability to send messages related to CQC within the system, will depend on the level of permission your account has access to.

The KLOE toolkit implemented within the system allows users to upload and submit documents, comments and evidence to show that your organisation is compliant with all the relevant clauses. You also can enter what level of rating your organisation has per site and be able to monitor and update it whenever needed.

## Complaints
The Complaints feature within the CQC module gives users a place to lodge complaints either openly or anonymously. These complaints can then be assigned to team members to investigate and find a resolution. All complaints are logged and kept track of and any progress made in resolving the issue is sent back to the recipient who created the complaint, regardless of their choice of confidentiality.

## Whistleblowing
Staff and team members can whistleblow confidentially or anonymously, but in either case, their whistleblow will be logged and investigations will be carried out and details will be captured in the same location. The original whistleblower can pick and choose who the details of the investigation will be reported to, and can keep track of progress made and when the investigation is closed or completed.

## Safeguarding
Users can raise their safeguarding concerns in this part of the CQC Module. Members of staff can conduct investigations and they also can securely refer the concern to a third party.

## Significant Events
Staff can raise events and assign them to team members for mitigation or the creation of an action plan. Users also have visibility of all ongoing as well as all closed events. 

## Reporting
Users can send reports via the system and attach files to these reports. This helps keep track of historical reports and keep a record of your reporting - there is no need to use the archaic email reporting methods.
