## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Task Manager` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to your Tasks click [here][Task Manager].

### Adding a Task

To begin, ensure you are on the tab named `Add task`, then choose the **Business Unit** you are assigning the Task to. *The Business Unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select the Business Units your Organisation has created and you have visibility of.*

After doing so, you must name the `Task` and give it a `Description`. Next, you need to assign the task to a member of staff - this can be left **Unassigned**.

You must input a due date for the task - this is the deadline of the task.

## Managing Tasks

*Please note that* `Partner` *business units can only view Tasks that they have been given access to AND are owned by their business unit.*

For each `Task`, you can either `Modify` or `Delete` them, much like with `Assets`, `Risks` and `Incidents`, however you can also `Assign` a Task to a user either from the `Modify` menu or during the creation of the task itself.
