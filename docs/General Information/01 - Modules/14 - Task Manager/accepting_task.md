# Accepting a Task

When you are assigned a task through the Task Manager, you receive the task in your `Requests` tab.

From here you need to click on the green tick under the **Actions** tab, the popup should ask you to confirm accepting the task and upon confirming it, it will be moved to the tab `My Tasks`

In this tab you can access the details, add comments and track progress and when finished, click `Complete` mark the task as complete.
