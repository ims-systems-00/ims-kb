## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Continual Improvement` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to OFIs click [here][OFI].

### OFI

An OFI is an Opportunity For Improvement - this can be for the Business Unit or a specific User.

To add an OFI, you must first navigate to the `Add new` tab, then choose the **Business Unit** you believe has an opportunity to improve, or the Business Unit that the User is in.

*The Business Unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the Business Units your organisation has created and that you have visibility of.*

The next thing to do is give the OFI a `Title` then fill the textbox labelled `Opportunity for improvement` with the description of the opportunity.

After that, decide on whom to assign the OFI to. *This is a drop-down menu that contains the names of Users assigned to the Business Unit you selected previously.*

Following this, fill the `Cost` with an estimated cost, if any.

You can then upload any attachements that may be necessary.

*Please note that* `Partner` *business units can only view OFIs if they have been given access to the Continual Improvement module AND the OFIs are owned by their Business Unit or a Business Unit they have visibility of.*

For each `OFI`, you can either `Modify` or `Delete` them, much like with `Assets`, `Risks` and `Incidents`, however, you can also `Implement` an OFI from the `Modify` menu.
