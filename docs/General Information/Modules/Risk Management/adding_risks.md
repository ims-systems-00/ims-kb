| **Description** 	| Rare	| Unlikely	| Possible	| Likely | Almost Certain |
|**Frequency** - <br/>How often it might/does happen | This will probably never happen | Do not expect it to happen/recur but it is possible | Might happen/recur occasionally | Will probably happen/recur but is not a persisting issue | Will undoubtedly happen/recur, possibly frequently |
|**Example** 		| Has never happened or over 15 years since the last occurrence | Between 10 and 15 years since the last occurrence | Between 2 and 10 years since the last occurrence | Between 6 months and 2 years since the last occurrence | Regularly or less than 6 months since the last occurrence |

| **Description** 	| Negligible | Minor | Moderate	| Major | Catastrophic |
| **Example**: <br/>Quality of Service | Small element of the service is sub-optimal | Overall service is sub-optimal | Overall service has significantly reduced effectiveness | Non-compliance with regulatory standards with significant risk to service effectiveness | Incident leading to totally unacceptable level of service or major disruptions |
| **Example**: <br/>Business Objectives / Projects | Insignificant cost increase | <5 percent over project budget | 5-10 percent over project budget | 10-25 percent over project budget <br/><br/>Key objectives not met | >25 percent over project budget <br/><br/>Key objectives not met |
