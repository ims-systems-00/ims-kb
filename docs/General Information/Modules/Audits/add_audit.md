### Categories

After clicking the `Audits` button, you must now select which category of Audits you want to create or view the schedule/history of.

The following categories are available.

+ Internal - These are Audits performed in-house
+ External - These are Audits performed by Compliance Bodies

*Note that Internal/External Audits still require you to create a Business Unit through which the Audits will be done.*

## Creating an Audit

You must first choose the `Business Unit` that will be Audited followed by the `Compliance Body` that will be performing the Audit. Next, you must give a `Title` for the Internal Audit followed by a description of the `Focus Area` for the Audit. Then pick the `Auditor`; this will be a drop-down menu featuring auditors that are assigned to the Compliance Body.

*The Business Unit and Compliance Body selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the Business Units and Compliance Bodies your organisation has created.*

Next, you assign the `Date` and `Time` for when the Audit will take place. 

After selecting the `Interval` of the audit, you can optionally add any relevant `Attachments` as well. Finally, click `Confirm` to submit the Audit to the **Schedule**.

*The Interval of the audit is used to show how often this particular Audit occurs. A separate entry will be automatically created to match the Interval. Any attachments will be added to the most recent upcoming Audit ONLY.*
