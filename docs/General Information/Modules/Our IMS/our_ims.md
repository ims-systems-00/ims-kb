# Business Units

## Creating a Business Unit

Please view the first time configuration guide [here][First Time Configuration] for information on creating Business Functions.

## Access Type

There are two types of Business Units.

+ Internal Function
+ External Function

Internal Functions are effectively departments within the same company - for example when making the HR Department you would pick `Internal Function` as the Access Type as it would be the policy put in place for internal users.

External Functions on the other hand are for outside parties that need access to the iMS System, such as Compliance Bodies that would audit your Organisation.

## Access Policy

`Access Policies` allow you to limit the features users within the Business Unit have access to.

You can view more information about Access Policies [here][Access Policies].

# Users

## Creating a User

To create a user, go to the `Create user` tab and fill in the form. 

User Type:

+ Internal Users have access to the system for as long as they are granted access
+ External Users can have their access automatically expire within 5 days, or have the same access rights as an Internal User.

## Granting Access to Users

In order to grant access to a User after creation, simply assign them to a Business Unit and click the green `key` icon to grant access.

*Note, to add a User to a Business Unit they must verify their email address*

## Deleting a User

To delete a User, you must first revoke their access to the System, remove them from the Business Units they are in then click the trash can icon next to their name in the `Users` tab.

You can add a single Premise to multiple Business Units and they will be displayed as a list.

You can edit Premises by clicking the eye icon and navigating to the `Amend premise` tab, and you can delete Premises using the trash can icon. The ability to delete Premises may be limited to Super Users if they were assigned to multiple Business Units during creation.

# License Management

## Organisation Overview

| Licenses Allocated |
| :----------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses allocated to your organisation by iMS. |

| Licenses Used |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses used for the various Business Units or Users within your organisation. |

| Licences Remaining |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses that are not used anywhere. |

## Internal / External

Here, you can view how Users are allocated to Business Units within your organisation.

**HOS**, **Basic** and **Auditor** are the three different User Types that can be created.

**User Licences are consumed upon creating a User**. These licences can be returned by deleting the user.

**Business Unit Licences are consume upon created a Business Unit**. These licences cannot be returned, as Business Units cannot be deleted.

To allocate or revoke **Toolkit access** within a Business Unit, simply click on the eye icon to the right of the Business Unit and navigate to the `Tools` tab. From here, you can use the form to either `Allocate` or `Revoke` **Toolkit access** within that specific Business Unit.

## Request / Requested

This is where you can request licences - if a HoS creates a request it would go to the Superadmin, a Superadmin creating the request would forward it to the iMS team.

The requested tab allows you to view requests you have made, and as a Superadmin, allows you to see requests made by the HoS users within your organisation. You can accept these requests to directly forward the request of licences to iMS.

You can also request access to specific Toolkits for your Business Unit or Organisation depending on user level, this functions the same as requesting User Licences.
