### Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Incident Management` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

Once you have selected this you will be able to raise an incident.

For more information on making amendments or modifications to your Incidents click [here][Incidents].

## Raising an Incident

Navigate to the `Raise Incident` tab.

You must first choose the **Business Unit** you are assigning the incident to. 

*The Business Unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the Business Units your organisation has created.*

After this you must enter the `Title` you want to give the incident, followed by a `Description` of the event. `Method of notification` is how you were made aware of the incident, this could be an email that was sent to your department.

Finally, enter a description of the `Affected service` and assign the incident a `Priority` level.

An example of the priority levels that could be in place are as follows, **these are only examples and may not be the policy your organisation follows.**

```
P1 = Priority 1 Escalation
Major System defects and crashes. Resolution in 6 hours.

P2 = Priority 2 Escalation
Issues with logging into accounts. Resolution in 9 hours.

P3 = Priority 3 Escalation
Document issues, help with navigation, and use of System. Resolution in 48 hours.

P4 = Priority 4 Escalation
Technical queries and advice. Resolution in 72 hours.
```

**Please note that the** `Organisational` **type usually only applies to P1 incidents, as they affect the entire system.**

To learn how to make changes to your Incident Resolution times, please follow [this guide][Our IMS - Resolution Times]

*Please note that* `Partner` *business units can only view Risks that they have been given access to AND are owned by their business unit.*

For each `Incident`, you can either `Modify`, `Escalate` or `Delete` them, much like with `Assets` and `Risks`.
