### Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Dashboard` button at the top of the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

The Dashboard is also the first screen you see upon logging in to your iMS account.

## Graphs

The information shown on the Dashboard changes depending on the level of permission granted to a specific user. For instance, a Superadmin will have access to the information of the entire organisation and will see under `Business Unit` the number of Business Units that are created within the organisation. On the other hand, a Head of Service user will only see the name of the business unit they are in charge of in the same place.

Superadmin:

+ This user has full visibility of the Dashboard as well as the organisational status

Head of Service 

+ This user can view all information of the Business Unit they manage.

Basic User

+ This user only has visibility of that which concerns their Business Unit.

Auditors

+ This user has visibility of the Organisational Dashboard - all Business Units.

IMS Partner

+ This user only has visibility of the functions for which they are responsible, these responsibilities can be assigned in the related Business Unit.

## Digital Maturity

Digital Maturity is a metric which determines how digital your organisation is. The objective of this module is to assist organisations in moving away from a manual process and introduce digitalisation and automation. This is a key factor in ensuring you have a successful digital transformation. With iMS Systems, we use algorithms to determine just how Digital your organisation is. As soon as you adopt the System, you are classified as `Digital`. The more you and your Users utilise the system, the higher the level of maturity - going from `Digital` to `Active` and then finally `Optimised`. You will be able to see the level of Digital Maturity on an overall basis, and also per Business Unit, alongside the percentage they have achieved towards the next level of maturity. The module will highlight relevant modules and a digital maturity score.

The modules tracked via Digital Maturity are:


- Inventory Management
- Risk Management
- Incident Management
- Supplier Management
- Document Management
- Continual Improvement
- Audits
- Task Manager (TBD)


When a Business Unit has achieved `Optimised` status, it will receive certification. This will be automatically sent to the Super Admin as well as the Head(s) of Service of that Business Unit. The certificate will be available in the Document Management module. This certification is proof of a successful transformation to digital maturity.

## Dashboard Report

The Dashboard Report can be sent to your email in a format that is designed to be easily readable.

You can access this on any page by clicking the Paper Airplane icon in the top right, to the left of the notification bell. After clicking the button a form will pop up requesting a `Name`, `Email`, and an optional `Message`. After clicking `Send` an email will be sent with the Dashboard Report attached to it. You will require relevant software to view the report that is sent.

It may take a few seconds for the report to be generated and sent, once the email has been sent you will receive a notification about the status of the delivery. The notification will tell you whether the email was sent successfully or not.

You can automate the delivery of Dashboard Reports using the `Report Interval` function. You can find more information on this [here][Report Interval]
