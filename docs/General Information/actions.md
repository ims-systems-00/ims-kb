When browsing a set of data presented on a table, there are a number of ways to search, sort, and present the information you are looking at.

## Search

Each table allows you to search relevant information to find a match. For example, if you are searching for a **Hardware Asset**, you have the option of searching by any of the following

+ Asset Name
+ Asset Tag
+ Asset Owner
+ Assigned Date
+ Returned Date
+ Business Unit

## Sort

Each table also allows you to customise how you wish to sort it. At the moment, you can only sort by A-Z (1-9) and Z-A (9-1) by clicking the arrow buttons next to the header of each column in the table.

## Change Pages

The default number of displayed rows is 10. You can switch between pages by clicking the numbered button at the bottom of a page.
