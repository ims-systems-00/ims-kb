#### Creating an Audit

*The Business Unit and Compliance Body selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the Business Units and Compliance Bodies your organisation has created.*

Next, you assign a `Date` and `Time` the Audit will take place. 

After selecting the `Interval` of the audit, click `confirm` to submit the Audit to the **Schedule**.
