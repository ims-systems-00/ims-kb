# Raising Incidents

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Incident Management` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

Once you have selected this you will be able to raise an incident.

For more information on making amendments or modifications to your Incidents click [here][Incidents].

### Raising an Incident

Navigate to the `Raise Incident` tab.

You must first choose the **Business Unit** you are assigning the incident to. 

*The Business Unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the Business Units your organisation has created.*

After this you must enter the `Title` you want to give the incident, followed by a `Description` of the event. `Method of notification` is how you were made aware of the incident, this could be an email that was sent to your department.

>“Hello Stanley! I am relaying to you the description of an incident that occurred at our workplace today. This may be worth entering into our Incident Management System. Hopefully, you receive this!
-	Employee 427 via AOL Messenger”

Finally, enter a description of the `Affected service` and assign the incident a `Priority` level.

An example of the priority levels that could be in place are as follows, **these are only examples and may not be the policy your organisation follows.**

```
P1 = Priority 1 Escalation
Major System defects and crashes. Resolution in 6 hours.

P2 = Priority 2 Escalation
Issues with logging into accounts. Resolution in 9 hours.

P3 = Priority 3 Escalation
Document issues, help with navigation, and use of System. Resolution in 48 hours.

P4 = Priority 4 Escalation
Technical queries and advice. Resolution in 72 hours.
```

**Please note that the** `Organisational` **type usually only applies to P1 incidents, as they affect the entire system.**

## Managing Incidents

*Please note that* `Partner` *business units can only view Risks that they have been given access to AND are owned by their business unit.*

For each `Incident`, you can either `Modify`, `Escalate` or `Delete` them, much like with `Assets` and `Risks`.

### Modifying an Incident

In order to `Amend` an incident, select the pencil icon under the `Actions` field.

When modifying an Incident, you may be limited by your level of access.

### Escalating an Incident

When escalating an Incident, you will be first asked to confirm the escalation of the Incident. Note that escalating an Incident will notify the Head of Service and Superadmin accounts of the incident that was escalated, as well as the `owner` of the incident.
