# Inventory Management

## Adding Assets

### Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Inventory` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making modifications or amendments to your assets click [here][Assets].

### Categories

After clicking the `Inventory` button, you must now select which category you are wanting to add an asset to or view the inventory of.

The following categories are available.
+ Hardware
+ Software
+ People
+ Premises
+ Information

#### Hardware

For **Hardware** assets, you must first choose the **Business Unit** you are assigning the hardware asset to. The business unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select the business functions your organisation has created.

From here, you enter the `name` and `tag` of the asset followed by the team member who is the `owner` of it. Following on, you need to enter the date the asset was `assigned` to the team member - this can be a date in the past or the future.

The `returned date` and `destruction date` can remain empty for now, as they can be filled in whenever necessary by [Modifying an Asset][].

After entering the `cost` of the asset, click `confirm` to submit the asset to your organisation's **Hardware** inventory.
