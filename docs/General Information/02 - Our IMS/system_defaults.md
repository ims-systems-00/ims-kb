Below is an example of how the resolution times may be set, refer to your organisation's policies for your own incident resolution times.

| Priority 				| Example 																			|
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Priority 1 Escalation | Major System defects and crash. Resolution in 6 hours. 							|
| Priority 2 Escalation | Issues with Logging into accounts. Resolution in 9 hours. 						|
| Priority 3 Escalation | Document issues, help with navigation and use of System. Resolution in 48 hours.	|
| Priority 4 Escalation | Technical queries and advice. Resolution in 72 hours.								|

The incident resolution time affects the relevant graphs on the Dashboard, as the Dashboard will reflect incidents being handled on time.
