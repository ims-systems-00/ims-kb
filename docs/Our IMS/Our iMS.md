# Business Units

## Create a Business Unit

To begin creating a new Business Unit, navigate to and click on the `Our iMS` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see a drawer open from the sidebar containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Business Units` and then on the `Create a function` tab.

This is where you can add Business Units to the system. You must first select the `Access type`.

The `Access type` selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the following options:

+ Internal function

    > This access type is effectively for teams or departments within the same company, such as HR, Operations and Finance.

+ External function

    > This access type is for outside parties that would need access to your iMS Systems, such as for Compliance Bodies that want to audit your Organisation.

After selecting the `Access type`, you will then need to select the `Access policy`. This dropdown consists of `iMS Business function`, `iMS Compliance body` as well as any other access policies you may have created yourself within the `Access Policies` section of `Our iMS`. 

*The form will be completely different based on this choice. Please note that any custom Access Policies will be treated the same as the `iMS Business function` access policy for the purposes of this form, so refer to that section for all custom access policies. You can view more information about Access Policies [here][Access Policies].*

### Creating a Business Unit with iMS Business Function Access Policy

After selecting `iMS Business function` or a custom policy for the `Access policy` dropdown, you will then need to enter the `Name` of the Business Unit, followed by its `Operating location` and `Responsibility`.

Finally, click `Confirm` to create the business unit. This will utilise 1 of your business unit licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this business unit, you will then be able to add members to it in order to grant your users access to the system.

*For business units created this way, you will be able to assign users as either a **iMS Basic User** or as a **iMS Head of service**.*

### Creating a Business Unit with iMS Compliance Body Access Policy

After selecting `iMS Compliance body` for the `Access policy` dropdown, you will then need to enter the name of the `Compliance body`, followed by what `Standards` they cover and their relevant `Responsibility`.

Finally, click `Confirm` to create the business unit. This will utilise 1 of your business unit licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this business unit, you will then be able to add members to it in order to grant your users access to the system.

*For business units created this way, you will only be able to assign users as an **iMS Auditor** within it.*

# Users

## Create a User

To begin creating a new user, navigate to and click on the `Our iMS` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see a drawer open from the sidebar containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Users` and then on the `Create user` tab.

This is where you can add Users to the system. You must first select the `User type`.

The `User type` selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the following options:

+ Internal

    > This user will have full time access to the system.

+ External

    > This user can either have their access automatically expire within 1 to 5 days, or have the same full time access as an Internal User.

*The form will differ slightly depending on this choice. These differences will be covered later in this section.*

After selecting the relevant `User type`, you will then enter the `Email`, followed by the `First name`, `Last name`, `Job title` and `Working place` of the user in question.

The `Working place` refers to whether the user is working **On-site** or **Remote**. This can be changed by the user themselves at any time from their Profile. 

For **Internal** users, you will then have the option to enter their `Salary` if you wish, followed by their `Line manager`. These are both optional fields and can be added/amended at any time from the users' profile page.

For **External** users, you will instead have the option to control their `Access period.` This can vary from anywhere between **1 to 5 days** or **Full time** access. You can change or grant additional access at any time after creation.

Finally, click `Confirm` to create the user. This will utilise 1 of your user licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this user, the system will send out an email to allow them to verify their account.

*Users must both be **verified** and be **assigned to a Business Unit** in order to access the system. Creating and assigning users to a Business Unit will be covered below.*

## Granting Access to Users

In order to grant access to a User after creation, simply assign them to a Business Unit.

Navigate to the "Business Units" heading within "Our IMS" and then click on the relevant Business Unit you wish to add the User to. Next, click on the "Add Members" tab and then select the User in question from the dropdown alongside their Licence Type. Finally, click "Confirm".

You can view more information about Licence Types [here][Licence Management].

*Note, if you do not assign them to a Business Unit, then they will still be able to verify their account, however they will be unable to sign into the system.*

## Revoking Access to Users

In order to revoke access to a User, simply click on the "actions" 

*Note, 

## Deleting a User

To delete a User, you must first revoke their access to the System, remove them from the Business Units they are in then click the trash can icon next to their name in the `Users` tab.

# Licence Management

## Organisation Overview

| Licences Allocated |
| :----------------- |
| This is the number of Licences allocated to your organisation by iMS. |

| Licences Used |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licences used for the various Business Units or Users within your organisation. |

| Licences Remaining |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licences that are not used anywhere. |

## Internal / External

Here, you can view how Users are allocated to Business Units within your organisation.

**HOS**, **Basic** and **Auditor** are the three different User Types that can be created.

**User Licences are consumed upon creating a User**. These licences can be returned by deleting the user.

**Business Unit Licences are consume upon created a Business Unit**. These licences cannot be returned, as Business Units cannot be deleted.

To allocate or revoke **Toolkit access** within a Business Unit, simply click on the eye icon to the right of the Business Unit and navigate to the `Tools` tab. From here, you can use the form to either `Allocate` or `Revoke` **Toolkit access** within that specific Business Unit.

## Request / Requested

This is where you can request licences - if a HoS creates a request it would go to the Superadmin, a Superadmin creating the request would forward it to the iMS team.

The requested tab allows you to view requests you have made, and as a Superadmin, allows you to see requests made by the HoS users within your organisation. You can accept these requests to directly forward the request of licences to iMS.

You can also request access to specific Toolkits for your Business Unit or Organisation depending on user level, this functions the same as requesting User Licences.
