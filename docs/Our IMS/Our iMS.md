# Business Units

## Create a Business Unit

To begin creating a new business unit, navigate to and click on the `Our iMS` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side. You will then see a drawer open from the sidebar containing the different pages within this module.

Click on `Business Units` and then on the `Create a function` tab.

This is where you can add business units to the system. You must first select the `Access type`.

The `Access type` selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the following options:

+ Internal function

    > This access type is effectively for teams or departments within the same company, such as HR, Operations and Finance.

+ External function

    > This access type is effectively for outside parties that would need access to your iMS Systems, such as for Compliance Bodies that want to audit your Organisation.

After selecting the `Access type`, you will then need to select the `Access policy`. This dropdown consists of `iMS Business function`, `iMS Compliance body` as well as any other access policies you may have created yourself within the `Access Policies` section of `Our iMS`. 

*The form will be completely different based on this choice. Please note that any custom Access Policies will be treated the same as the `iMS Business function` access policy for the purposes of this form, so refer to that section for all custom access policies. You can view more information about Access Policies [here][Access Policies].*

### Creating a Business Unit with iMS Business Function Access Policy

After selecting `iMS Business function` or a custom policy for the `Access policy` dropdown, you will then need to enter the `Name` of the Business Unit, followed by its `Operating location` and `Responsibility`.

Finally, click `Confirm` to create the business unit. This will utilise 1 of your business unit licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this business unit, you will then be able to add members to it in order to grant your users access to the system.

*For business units created this way, you will be able to assign users as either a **iMS Basic User** or as a **iMS Head of service**.*

### Creating a Business Unit with iMS Compliance Body Access Policy

After selecting `iMS Compliance body` for the `Access policy` dropdown, you will then need to enter the name of the `Compliance body`, followed by what `Standards` they cover and their relevant `Responsibility`.

Finally, click `Confirm` to create the business unit. This will utilise 1 of your business unit licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this business unit, you will then be able to add members to it in order to grant your users access to the system.

*For business units created this way, you will only be able to assign users as an **iMS Auditor** within it.*

After selecting the relevant `User type`, you will then enter the `Email`, followed by the `First name`, `Last name`, `Job title` and `Working place` of the user in question.

The `Working place` refers to whether the user is working **On-site** or **Remote**. This can be changed by the user themselves at any time from their Profile. 

For **Internal** users, you will then have the option to enter their `Salary` if you wish, followed by their `Line manager`. These are both optional fields and can be added/amended at any time from the users' profile page.

For **External** users, you will instead have the option to control their `Access period.` This can vary from anywhere between **1 to 5 days** or **Full time** access. You can change or grant additional access at any time after creation.

Finally, click `Confirm` to create the user. This will utilise 1 of your user licences which you will be able to see a summary of on the right side of this tab. After creating this user, the system will send out an email to allow them to verify their account.
